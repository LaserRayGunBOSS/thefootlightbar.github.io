SING FOR A CAUSE!

A karaoke fundraiser series hosted by yours truly.

Join us for a night of singing and dancing, all in the name of doing some good in the world. (What could be better?)

Proceeds to benefit our Bushwick based hero, [Make the Road New York](https://www.facebook.com/MakeTheRoadNewYork/)!!

Doors open at 7, but come by early to knock a few back and claim your spot in the karaoke line up :)

Rocky road cookies and other sweet treats will be on sale for donations.

$5 cover, $1 per song

(No one will be turned away for lack of funds.)

See you all there!!
