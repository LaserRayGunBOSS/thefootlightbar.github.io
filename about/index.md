The Footlight Bar is a quirky neighborhood bar, art space and music venue in historic Ridgewood, Queens nestled just north or the notorious L train and a few blocks away from the shiny new to you M train. Footlight is the brainchild of Laura Bridget Regan, native of Boston, Ma, Ridgewood resident since 2013. The bar and venue are run with care and compassion by a group of reliable talented friends and family. When you come to Footlight you should feel like part of the crew, marvel at our amazing sound system, absorb the eclectic, bizzare art and decor, and experience something you haven't before. 

The Footlight is a 21+ establishment after 8PM. We do hold children's and all ages matinee events on Saturday afternnons. We host a parent/caregiver meet up every Friday between 2:30-5:30PM seasonally October- May as well as occasional fitness classes, Zine fests, flea markets & more.
