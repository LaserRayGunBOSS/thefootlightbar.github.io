Back Stage,American Single: A Live Dating Show,2019-01-22,21:00:00,2019-01-22,23:00:00,,,,,,"
**ARTIST FAVORITE AWARD WINNER AT RVK FRINGE 2018**

Swipe right for American Single! Two strangers (one single American girl + one volunteer from the audience) transition from “It’s a Match!” to their first date within a matter of minutes. It’s awkward, it’s taboo, and it is definitely a funny story you’ll be telling your friends later.

This is an award winning, audience-interactive show, that exists on the border between stand-up, improv, and performance art. Olivia invites the audience to open their phones (and hearts!) by matching with her through a popular dating app, then takes one lucky suitor up onto the stage where they have a REAL FIRST DATE in front of a live audience-- an audience which is offering their every thought and criticism of the date via live poll. Will they find love? Intimacy? Another one night stand? Every first date is different and entirely unpredictable.

American Single bravely explores the space between the personal and the private, while challenging its viewers to step out of their comfort zones in the name of true love. Can a real, honest connection be found under such artificial circumstances? American Single ventures to find out.

Reviews

""Question your online dating choices, question your dating habits, but don’t question if you want to see this show. American Single is always a match!""
- Jessica LoMonaco, Fringe Co-Director

""Like watching a bus full of clowns crash into a firework factory: a disaster but still colorful and immensely funny.""
- Ingimar Bjarni, Reykjavik Fringe

Back Stage,Saga of the Shining Emblem,2019-01-29,21:00:00,2019-01-29,23:00:00,,,,,,"
There is a legend around these parts. The legend foretells a great darkness sweeping over the land. A great, over-powering force that will decimate our land and leave naught but ash in its wake. The signs are clear. The darkness is coming and all are in danger.

The legend does not end there, however. The legend also speaks of a great hero. A powerful force for light, rising up to challenge the darkness. A chosen warrior of goodness bearing the true mark of courage, a Shining Emblem. It is said this hero will first appear in Ridgewood at the place where destiny and fate meet: The Footlight Bar.

One lucky audience member will be selected to quest for the Shining Emblem!  They will brave the elements, face danger and become a legend! All set to a live score!

January 29th, 9pm. The legend continues. Will you be the hero of legend? Will you side with the darkness? Or will you forge a new path? The choice is yours! Come to the Footlight Bar in Ridgewood to find out if you have the makings of a hero! Tickets only 7$!

The Emblem is calling you. Are you ready to be the hero you were born to be?",,CONFIRMED,https://shiningemblem.com/,
