With Mavens of Ceremony Junior Mintt and Comrade Barbie, the QCRC aims to showcase queer performers of all genders and backgrounds for our friends and neighbors, in a positive and affordable environment. 

Conveniently located off the L and M trains, The Footlight Bar of Ridgewood will host this most auspicious occasion, the debut of a decedent four hours‚Äô traffic of our stage.

Here, we take the theatrical traditions from the courts of despots and tyrants, ‚Äúillustrious patrons of the arts,‚Äù and claim them for every kind of audience. Here, the trappings of glitz and glam come second to the art of The Show. Many wild  performances are promised for all, the likes of which Netflix could never produce.

Also! Games, Comedy, and Vendors, featuring the jewelry of neighborhood staple the Prince Peacock.

The inaugural event will take place on the 26th of February, with doors opening at 8pm. $8 in advance, $10 at the door. ALL are welcome. For more info follow us @queenscountyroyalcourt on Instagram and Facebook or go to queenscountyroyalcourt.com. Online ticket sales coming soon!
