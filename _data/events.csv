Back Stage,Shift-CTRL Space's I/O: Server Setup Walkthrough Using CentOS and the Network File System,2019-03-17,14:30:00,2019-03-17,18:00:00,,,,,,"The Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS) is a free distribution of the GNU/Linux operating system used by large corporations all over the world. It is known for its stability and extended periods of software support, making it a leading choice for commercial and non-profit organizations of any size. It also features strong security controls, shipping with the Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) kernel security module enabled by default. 

At this week's I/O, we will walk through a complete example scenario in which a small business needs to deploy their first Information Technology (IT) system in-house. Using the CentOS distribution, we will demonstrate how a single system administrator can provision and deploy the Network File System (NFS) running on one (server) machine in order to offer a “cloud computing” environment where multiple connected devices (clients) can read and write files within a corporate or organizational intranet. To securely deploy such a solution, we will also walk through the proper configuration of the built-in Linux network firewall using the firewalld management utility, a minimal Secure Shell (SSH) setup for remote administration, and how to ensure only the users who need access privileges are granted such access. 

This event is: Individuals/Organizations.",https://shiftctrl.space/img/logo.bw.svg,CONFIRMED,https://shiftctrl.space/#io-calendar,
