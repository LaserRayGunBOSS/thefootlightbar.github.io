A great, over-powering force that will decimate our land and leave naught but ash in its wake. The signs are clear. The darkness is coming and all are in danger.

The legend does not end there, however. The legend also speaks of a great hero. A powerful force for light, rising up to challenge the darkness. A chosen warrior of goodness bearing the true mark of courage, a Shining Emblem. It is said this hero will first appear in Ridgewood at the place where destiny and fate meet: The Footlight Bar.

One lucky audience member will be selected to quest for the Shining Emblem!  They will brave the elements, face danger and become a legend! All set to a live score!

January 29th, 9pm. The legend continues. Will you be the hero of legend? Will you side with the darkness? Or will you forge a new path? The choice is yours! Come to the Footlight Bar in Ridgewood to find out if you have the makings of a hero! Tickets only 7$!

The Emblem is calling you. Are you ready to be the hero you were born to be?",,CONFIRMED,https://shiningemblem.com/,
